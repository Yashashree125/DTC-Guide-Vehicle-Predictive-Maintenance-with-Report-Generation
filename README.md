# DTC Guide-Vehicle-Predictive-Maintenance-with-Report-Generation

This project presents an intelligent, end-to-end platform for **predictive maintenance and real-time fault diagnosis** in the automotive sector. Leveraging machine learning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system enables early detection of mechanical issues, predicts Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), and generates comprehensive diagnostic reports based on OBD data. Designed as a full-stack application, it integrates seamlessly into service centres, fleet operations, and OEM systems.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Predictive Fault Detection**: Real-time prediction of vehicle failures using OBD sensor data.
- **DTC Classification**: Accurate identification of Diagnostic Trouble Codes using machine learning models.
- **Synthetic Data Balancing**: SMOTE and GAN-based augmentation to address data imbalance.
- **RAG-Based Diagnostic Report Generation**: Combines structured and unstructured data of vehicle manuals to generate fault-specific, human-readable reports with LLM [GPT-4o].
- RAG Components: FAISS, LangChain-style pipeline (custom-built)
